# Heat Map

## Introduction
This heat map shows the monthly difference in global land-surface temperature compared to a base temperature of 8.66â„ƒ.  
The data range is from the year 1753 up to 2015.

Heat maps are useful for representing large data sizes and quickly indicate trends.

This heat map is made with [D3](https://d3js.org/).

This project is part of freeCodeCamps Data Visualization certificate.

## Project Requirements
* The heat map should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
* The heat map should have a description with a corresponding id="description".
* The heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis".
* The heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".
* The heat map should have rect elements with a class="cell" that represent the data.
* There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.
* Each cell will have the properties data-month, data-year, data-temp containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values.
* The data-month, data-year of each cell should be within the range of the data.
* The heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.
* The heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.
* The heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.
* The heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.
* The heat map should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend".
* The legend should contain rect elements.
* The rect elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.
* Moving the mouse over an area shows a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
* The tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-year of the active area.
